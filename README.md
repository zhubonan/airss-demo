This repository defines a binder environment for running interactive demonstrations for Ab-initio Random Structure Searching.
Click the badge above to launch a cloud hosted Jupyter notebook environment with AIRSS pre-installed. 
You can explore the examples and see the structure searching in action.

Note

The link takes you directly to a terminal. Some basic knowledge of Linux command line (bash) is needed to run the samples.
You can still browse the examples in the browser based file explorer by click the Jupyter logo at top left.
